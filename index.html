            Monocrystalline Solar Panels: Highly efficient in both power output and space. Built to last which means fewer repair and replacement costs. Costly.<br>
            This type of solar panel is the purest one. You can easily recognise them from the uniform dark look. The silicon’s high purity causes this type of solar panel has one of the highest efficiency rates, with the newest ones reaching above 20%.

          Polycrystalline Solar Panels: Less efficient, lower lifespan, and
          sensitive to high temperatures. But much more cost efficient.<br />
          You can quickly distinguish these panels because it has a blue,
          speckled look. They are made by melting raw silicon, which is a faster
          and cheaper process than that used for monocrystalline panels.

I’ll just be paying the minimum on my electricity. Instead of paying our electricity bill, we’re paying for our solar system. "</p>

        <h3>Frequently <br>
            Asked <br>
             Questions?</h3>
             <div>
                <p>
                    <ul> What is solar electricity?
Solar electricity is electricity that’s generated through the use of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. Solar PV panels are used to capture the sun’s free and clean renewable energy, turning it into electricity.</ul>

<ul> How does a solar PV system work?
Solar PV systems feature an array of cells which contain a solar PV material that can convert radiation from the sun into direct current (DC) electricity. The electricity that is generated can be used to provide power for lighting and electrical equipment around the home.</ul>

<ul> How many solar panels will my home need?
The more solar panels you have installed, the more energy they’ll be able to generate for your home. The number of solar panels you’ll need will depend on your energy usage, the number of people in your home and the size of your property. Smaller homes might need a 1kW system, with roof space for 8+ square metres of solar panels, while higher demand can be met with a 4kW system, but that would need 25+ square metres of space on your roof.</ul>

<ul> How does solar benefit the environment?
Well, for starters it’s a renewable source of energy, so unlike coal it won’t run out. Plus solar energy is environmentally friendly because it doesn’t generate green house gases. Renewable energy technologies will help you reduce your carbon footprint, meaning you’ll personally be doing your bit for the environment.</ul>

<ul> What is a solar battery?
More often that not, solar panels are generating more energy that can be used around the home at any one time. All the excess energy is then sent to the electricity grid, meaning that you’re losing out on energy being generated by your panels. By including a solar battery as part of your solar PV system, you can hold onto the unused energy to use during the night when your solar panels aren’t generating any energy.</ul>
