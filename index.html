          Monocrystalline Solar Panels: Highly efficent in both power output and
          space. Built to last meaning fewer repair and replacements. Costly.<br />
          This type of solar panels (made of monocrystalline silicon) is the
          purest one. You can easily recognise them from the uniform dark look.
          The siliconâ€™s high purity causes this type of solar panel has one of
          the highest efficiency rates, with the newest ones reaching above 20%.

          Polycrystalline Solar Panels: Less efficient, lower lifespan, and
          sensitive to high temperatures. But much more cost efficient.<br />
          You can quickly distinguish these panels because it has a blue,
          speckled look. They are made by melting raw silicon, which is a faster
          and cheaper process than that used for monocrystalline panels.
